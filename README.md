Cyber Activity Risk Analyzer – Personalized Security Engine

Roll Number: AP24110011591

Register Digit (D): 1

Explanation:

The last digit of my register number is 1.

D = 1, which is an odd number.

According to the personalized security filter rules:

If D is EVEN → Low Risk scores are removed
If D is ODD → Critical Risk scores are removed

Since my D value is odd, the program removes all Critical Risk scores
after categorization.

Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk scores remain unchanged.
