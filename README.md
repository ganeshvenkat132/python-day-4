# Cyber Activity Risk Analyzer – Personalized Security Engine

## Student Details
Roll Number: AP24110011591

## Personalized Register Digit
D Value: 1

## Explanation of Filtering Logic

The last digit of my register number is **1**, therefore:

D = 1 → ODD

According to the assignment rules:

• If D is EVEN → Remove Low Risk scores  
• If D is ODD → Remove Critical Risk scores

Since my D value is **odd**, the program removes all **Critical Risk**
activity scores after categorization.

Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk scores remain unchanged.
